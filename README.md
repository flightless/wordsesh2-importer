WordSesh2 Demo - User Importer
==================

A simple user importer plugin. It expects a CSV file with three columns.

1. user name
2. email address
3. password

Here's a sample: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqnIEx5v8_AGdFBTbk5xSDZrdzlVWXNBbGplRWZCckE&usp=sharing

Export that as a CSV, and it will work with this importer.
